# Password Generator
**Disclaimer:** I completed this assignment before realizing there was starter code, it is my fault for not realizing and properly following the instructions. That being said, I kept the page I designed because I feel it properly satisfies the acceptance criteria and delivers a good user experience.

## Description
This is a website I designed from scratch that allows the user to generate a password based on criteria chosen by the user. I used my background in javascript to create efficient and responsive code. I believe there is room for further optimization, and I may revisit this project for further improvement at a later date.

## Usage
- Use the checkboxes to select which character types you want in your generated password
- Enter the minimum and maximum length for your password
- Click the "Generate" button to generate your password
- Click on the generated password to copy the text to your clipboard
